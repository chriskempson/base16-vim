* [iTerm2](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2)

## Installation
To use the dark theme ensure `set background=dark` is present in your `~/.vimrc` file. Otherwise Vim will use the light variation by default.

Add `colorscheme base16-default` to your `~/.vimrc`.

### Vundle
Add the following to your `~/.vimrc` file.

    Bundle 'chriskempson/base16-vim'

### Manual
    cd ~/.vim/colors
    git clone git://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim.git base16
    cp base16/colors/*.vim .
    
## 265 colorspace 
If using a Base16 terminal theme designed to keep the 16 ANSI colors intact (a "256" variation) and have sucessfully modified your 256 colorspace with [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) you'll need to add the following to your `~/.vimrc` **before** the colorsheme declaration.

    let base16colorspace=256  " Access colors present in 256 colorspace

This will cause vim to acess the colours in the modified 256 colorpsace. Please **do not** enable this simply because you have a 256 color terminal as this will cause colors to be displayed incorrectly.
